                <p>Apples are one of the most popular fruits in the U.S. and are known for their numerous health benefits, including improving digestion and protecting against chronic illnesses like diabetes and heart disease.</p>
                <h2>Supports Heart Health</h2>
                <p>Apples, especially with the skin on, are a rich source of fiber, <a href="https://www.chhs.colostate.edu/krnc/monthly-blog/what-are-polyphenols-another-great-reason-to-eat-fruits-and-veggies/">polyphenols</a>, and other nutrients that support heart health. </p>
                <p>Several studies have linked apples to a lower risk of heart disease. One review found that eating about one small apple daily is associated with a decreased risk of heart disease and risk factors such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure.</p>
                <p>In addition, daily apple consumption was associated with a 27% lower risk of dying from a stroke and a 25% lower risk of dying from heart disease.</p>
                <h2>Improves Digestion</h2>
                <p>Apples are a good source of pectin, a soluble fiber that can improve digestion.</p>
                <p>As a soluble fiber, pectin absorbs water in the digestive tract, creating larger, softer stools that are easier to pass.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/what-is-pectin?srsltid=AfmBOooUcjOrlUYdSqghNt_GDBY2SZr0FfvgXSKP7gkH2OtiesVpFz-Y">Pectin</a> is also recognized as a prebiotic that encourages the growth and activity of beneficial bacteria in the gut.</p>
                <h2>Helps Manage Weight</h2>
                <p>Apples are high in water and fiber yet low in calories, which can support weight management by keeping you full and reducing your daily calorie intake. </p>
                <p>One study linked a higher intake of fiber-rich fruits and vegetables to weight loss.</p> 
                <p>Participants who frequently ate apples lost an average of 1.24 pounds over four years. </p>
                <p>Another review found that apple intake significantly decreased body mass index (BMI). However, no significant differences in body weight were found.</p>
